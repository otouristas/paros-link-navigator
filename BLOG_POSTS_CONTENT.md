### Car Rental Considerations

When renting a car for Antiparos:

- **Fuel:** Return with same fuel level as pickup

### Why Take a Car vs. Scooter?

**Advantages of a Car:**
- Air conditioning (important in summer!)
- Storage for beach gear, picnic supplies
- Better for families with children

- Protection from sun and wind

**When to Consider a Scooter:**
- Easier parking in Antiparos Town
- Lower ferry cost
