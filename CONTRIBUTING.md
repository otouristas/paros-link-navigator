```

## üìù Coding Standards

### TypeScript

- **Strict Mode:** Always enabled
- **Type Safety:** No `any` types unless absolutely necessary
- **Interfaces:** Use interfaces for object shapes
- **Enums:** Use for fixed sets of values

```typescript
// ‚úÖ Good
interface VehicleProps {
  name: string;
  category: string;
  price: number;
}

// ‚ùå Bad
const vehicle: any = { ... };
```

### React

- **Functional Components:** Use hooks, not class components
- **Props:** Always type your props
- **State:** Use appropriate hooks (useState, useReducer)
- **Effects:** Clean up side effects

```typescript
// ‚úÖ Good
interface ButtonProps {
  onClick: () => void;
  children: React.ReactNode;
  variant?: 'primary' | 'secondary';
}

export function Button({ onClick, children, variant = 'primary' }: ButtonProps) {
  return (
    <button onClick={onClick} className={`btn btn-${variant}`}>
      {children}
    </button>
  );
}

// ‚ùå Bad
export function Button(props: any) {
  return <button onClick={props.onClick}>{props.children}</button>;
}
```

### Styling (Tailwind CSS)

- **Utility Classes:** Use Tailwind utilities
- **Responsive:** Mobile-first approach
- **Dark Mode:** Include `dark:` variants
- **Custom Classes:** Only when necessary

```typescript
// ‚úÖ Good
<div className="p-4 bg-white dark:bg-gray-800 rounded-lg shadow-md">
  <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-white">
    Title
  </h2>
</div>

// ‚ùå Bad
<div style={{ padding: '16px', backgroundColor: 'white' }}>
  <h2 style={{ fontSize: '24px' }}>Title</h2>
</div>
```

### Naming Conventions

- **Components:** PascalCase (`VehicleCard.tsx`)
- **Hooks:** camelCase with 'use' prefix (`useVehicles.ts`)
- **Utilities:** camelCase (`formatDate.ts`)
- **Constants:** UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (`MAX_VEHICLES`)
- **Interfaces:** PascalCase with 'I' prefix optional (`VehicleData` or `IVehicleData`)

### File Organization

- **One Component Per File:** Each component in its own file
- **Co-locate Related Files:** Keep tests, styles near components
- **Barrel Exports:** Use `index.ts` for cleaner imports

```typescript
// components/Button/index.ts
export { Button } from './Button';
export type { ButtonProps } from './Button';
```

### Comments

- **Why, Not What:** Explain complex logic
- **JSDoc:** For public APIs
- **TODO:** Use for future improvements

```typescript
/**
 * Formats a date for display in the booking form.
 * Converts YYYY-MM-DD to DD/MM/YYYY for the external booking system.
 */
function formatDate(dateStr: string): string {
  const [year, month, day] = dateStr.split('-');
  return `${day}/${month}/${year}`;
}
```

## üì¶ Commit Guidelines

### Commit Message Format

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

### Types

- **feat:** New feature
- **fix:** Bug fix
- **docs:** Documentation changes
- **style:** Code style changes (formatting, semicolons, etc.)
- **refactor:** Code refactoring
- **test:** Adding or updating tests
- **chore:** Maintenance tasks

### Examples

```bash
feat(fleet): add vehicle filtering by transmission type

Add dropdown filter to allow users to filter vehicles by automatic
or manual transmission. Includes URL parameter support for deep linking.

Closes #123
```

```bash
fix(booking): correct date format for external booking system

The booking form was sending dates in YYYY-MM-DD format, but the
external system expects DD/MM/YYYY. Added formatDate helper function.

Fixes #456
```

```bash
docs(readme): update installation instructions

Add missing step for Supabase configuration and clarify
environment variable setup.
```

### Best Practices

- Use imperative mood ("add feature" not "added feature")
- Keep subject line under 50 characters
- Separate subject from body with blank line
- Wrap body at 72 characters
- Reference issues and pull requests
