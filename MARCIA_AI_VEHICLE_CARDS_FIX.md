### 2. **Vehicle Cards Logic Fixed** ✅

#### **What Was Fixed:**

1. **Added Console Logging:**
   - Now logs how many cars are available
   - Check browser console (F12) to see: `Available cars: X`

2. **Added Safety Checks:**
   - Only shows cards if `vehicles.length > 0`
   - Prevents showing empty card sections

3. **Expanded Keywords:**
   - More trigger words for each category
   - Better matching for user queries

4. **Reordered Logic:**
   - Vehicle queries checked BEFORE generic info queries
   - Prevents generic responses from blocking vehicle displays

5. **Updated Initial Suggestions:**
   - New buttons that DEFINITELY trigger vehicle cards
   - More direct, action-oriented prompts

## 🔍 Debugging Steps

### **Step 1: Check Console**
1. Open chat
2. Press **F12** to open Developer Tools
3. Type any prompt
4. Look for: `Available cars: X`

**What it means:**
- `Available cars: 0` → Database is empty or not connected
- `Available cars: 15` → Database working, should show cards

---

### **Step 2: Check Network**
1. Open Developer Tools (F12)
2. Go to **Network** tab
3. Open chat (look for Supabase API calls)
4. Type a prompt

**Look for:**
- API calls to `kgstuurlhljfqbxtndcw.supabase.co`
- Status `200` = Success
- Status `400` = Error (database issue)

---

### **Step 3: Test with Suggestion Button**
1. Open chat
2. **Click** (don't type) the suggestion button: **"Show me cheap cars"**
3. Wait 2 seconds
4. Cards should appear

**If cards DON'T appear after clicking button:**
- Database is likely empty or not connected
- Check console for errors
- Verify Supabase connection

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### **Issue 1: "Available cars: 0" in Console**

**Cause:** Database is empty or Supabase not connected

**Fix:**
1. Check Supabase dashboard
2. Verify `cars` table has data
3. Confirm `agency = 'aggelos-rentals'` filter has matching vehicles
4. Check if RLS policies allow reading

---

### **Issue 2: Cards Don't Show, But Console Says "Available cars: 15"**

**Cause:** Filter logic might not be matching your database categories

**Fix:**
1. Check what categories your vehicles have
2. Update filters in code if needed
3. Example: If your database uses `'Economy'` instead of `'economy'`, filters won't match

**Quick Check:**
```typescript
// In browser console, type:
allCars.map(car => car.category)
// See what categories exist
```

---

### **Issue 3: Only Some Prompts Work**

**Cause:** Some vehicle types might be missing in database

**What Works:**
- Economy: Needs `category: 'economy'` or `'compact'`
- Family: Needs `seats >= 5` AND `type: 'Car'`
- Scooter: Needs `type: 'Motorbike'`
- ATV: Needs `type: 'ATV / QUAD'`
- SUV: Needs `category: 'suv'` OR `'jeep'` OR `'family'`

**Fix:**
Add vehicles to your database with correct categories and types

If vehicle cards STILL don't appear after:
1. ✅ Using exact prompts from this guide
