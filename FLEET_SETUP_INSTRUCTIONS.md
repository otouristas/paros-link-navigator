## üîß INSTALLATION STEPS

### Step 1: Install Dependencies

Run this command in your terminal:

```bash
npm install
```

This will install the Supabase client library that was added to package.json.

---

### Step 2: Create .env File

Create a file named `.env` in the root directory with:

```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://kgstuurlhljfqbxtndcw.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsInJlZiI6Imtnc3R1dXJsaGxqZnFieHRuZGN3Iiwicm9sZSI6ImFub24iLCJpYXQiOjE3NDM0MjAwODUsImV4cCI6MjA1ODk5NjA4NX0.XZECnAv6cGCzUBHjnW-N1Xw2RCEC8HNipVNjicEAeE8
```

**Note:** The credentials are also hardcoded in `src/lib/supabase.ts` as fallback, so the app will work even without the .env file.

---

### Step 3: Set Up Supabase Database

Your Supabase `cars` table should have these columns:

| Column | Type | Required | Description |
|--------|------|----------|-------------|
| `id` | uuid | Yes | Primary key |
| `agency_name` | text | Yes | Filter by "aggelos rentals" |
| `make` | text | Yes | Car make (e.g., "Toyota") |
| `model` | text | Yes | Car model (e.g., "Aygo") |
| `year` | integer | Yes | Year of manufacture |

| `type` | text | Yes | car, scooter, atv, bike |
| `price_per_day` | numeric | Yes | Daily rental price |
| `seats` | integer | Yes | Number of seats |
| `transmission` | text | Yes | manual or automatic |
| `fuel_type` | text | No | petrol, diesel, hybrid, electric |
| `doors` | integer | No | Number of doors |
| `engine_size` | text | No | e.g., "1.0L", "125cc" |
| `features` | text[] | Yes | Array of features |
| `image_url` | text | Yes | Main image URL |
| `images` | text[] | No | Additional images |
| `description` | text | Yes | Vehicle description |
| `available` | boolean | Yes | Availability status |
| `created_at` | timestamp | Yes | Created timestamp |
| `updated_at` | timestamp | No | Updated timestamp |

---

### Step 4: Match Photos to Database

Your fleet photos are in `src/assets/fleet/`. To use them:

1. Upload photos to Supabase Storage or
2. Use relative paths like `/src/assets/fleet/toyota-aygo.jpg`
3. Update `image_url` in database to match photo names

**Example photo names in your folder:**
- toyota-aygo.jpg
- suzuki-jimny-paros-rent-a-car.webp
- fiat-panda.jpeg
- scooter-125.jpg
- atv-15cc.png
- liberty-125.webp
